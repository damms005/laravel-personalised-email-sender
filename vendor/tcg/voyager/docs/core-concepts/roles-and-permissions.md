# Roles and Permissions

Voyager comes with Roles and Permissions out of the box. Each _User_ has a _Role_ which has a set of _Permissions_.

Inside of the dashboard you can choose to Add, Edit, or delete the current Roles. Additionally when you click to edit a particular role you can specify the BREAD permissions.

New in version 1.0, we've changed Voyager's authorization system to be [more in line with Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#authorizing-actions-using-policies)! This means that you can check for permissions in the following ways:

```php
// via user object
$canViewPost = $user->can('read', $post);
$canViewPost = Auth::user()->can('read', $post);

// via controller
$canViewPost = $this->authorize('read', $post);
```

Out of the box there are some permissions you can use by default:

* `browse_admin`: Whether or not the user may browse the Voyager admin panel.
* `browse_database`: Whether or not the user may browse the Voyager database menu section.
* `browse_bread`: Whether or not the user may browse the Voyager BREAD menu section.
* `browse_media`: Whether or not the user may browse the Voyager media section.
* `browse_menu`: Whether or not the user may browse the Voyager menu section.
* `browse_settings`: Whether or not the user may browse the Voyager settings section.
* `read_settings`: Whether or not the user can view or see a particular setting.
* `edit_settings`: Whether or not the user can edit a particular setting.
* `add_settings`: Whether or not the user can add a new setting.
* `delete_settings`: Whether or not the user can delete a particular setting.

Additionally you can `Generate permissions` for every BREAD type you create. This will create the `browse`, `read`, `edit`, `add` and `delete` permission.

As an example, perhaps we are creating a new BREAD type from a `products` table. If we choose to `Generate permissions` for our `products` table. Our permission keys will be `browse_products`, `read_products`, `edit_products`, `add_products` and `delete_products`.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notice**  
If a menu item is associated with any kind of BREAD, then it will check for the `browse` permission, for example for the `Posts` BREAD menu item, it will check for the `browse_posts` permission. If the user does not have the required permission, that menu item will be hidden.
{% endhint %}

## Using Permissions in your Blade Template files

You can also check for permissions using blade syntax. Let's say for instance that you want to check if a user can `browse_posts`, simple enough we can use the following syntax:

```php
@can('browse', $post)
    I can browse posts
@endcan
```

Or perhaps you need to run an else condition for a permission. That's simple enough:

```php
@can('browse', $post)
    I can browse posts
@else
    I cannot browse posts
@endcan
```

Couldn't be easier, right ;\)
